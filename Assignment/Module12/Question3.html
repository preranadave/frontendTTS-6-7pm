    <h1>What is pure component?</h1>
    <p>
      In React, a Pure Component is a component that only re-renders when its
      props or state change. It performs a shallow comparison of the current and
      next props/state to determine if it needs to update. This can lead to
      performance optimizations by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
    </p>
    <h1>When to use Pure Component over Component?</h1>
    <p>
      Performance Optimization: If you have components that receive complex
      objects as props and you want to avoid unnecessary renders, a Pure
      Component can help. It automatically handles shallow comparison for you.</p>

      <p></p>Stable Props: When you know that props will not change frequently, using a
      Pure Component can help optimize rendering. 
      <p>Avoiding Manual
      shouldComponentUpdate: If you were planning to implement
      shouldComponentUpdate in a regular component to control updates, a Pure
      Component can simplify your code since it already implements this logic.</p>
      <p>
      Functional Components with React.memo: For functional components, you can
      achieve similar optimizations using React.memo, which performs the same
      shallow comparison.</p>
