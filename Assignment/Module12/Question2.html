    <h1>What is Redux Thunk used for?</h1>
    <p>
      Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action
      creators that return a function instead of an action. This is particularly
      useful for handling asynchronous operations, such as API calls or complex
      logic that needs to be executed before dispatching actions.
