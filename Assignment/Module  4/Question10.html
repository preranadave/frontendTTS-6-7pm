    <h1>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h1>
    <p> The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.</p>
    <h2>There are two reasons behind this: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it
            is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
        </li>
        <li>Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.</li>
    </ul>
