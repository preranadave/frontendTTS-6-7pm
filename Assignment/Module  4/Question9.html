    <h1>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h1>
    <p>The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image will scroll along with the rest of the
        elements on the page when the user slides the scroll-bar in the browser or whether the image will stay fixed to
        the page. The background-attachment property can either be set to scroll or fixed.
    </p>
