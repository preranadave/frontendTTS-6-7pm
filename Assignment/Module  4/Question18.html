    <h1>What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h1>
    <ul>

        <li>
            handheld:
            Intended for handheld devices (typically small screen, limited bandwidth).

        <li>
            print:
            Intended for paged material and for documents viewed on screen in print preview mode. Please consult the
            section
            on paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media.</li>
        <li>
            projection:
            Intended for projected presentations, for example projectors. Please consult the section on paged media for

            Intended primarily for color computer screens.</li>
        <li>speech:
            Intended for speech synthesizers. Note: CSS2 had a similar media type called 'aural' for this purpose. See

        </li>
        <li> tv:
