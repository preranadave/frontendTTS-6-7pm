    What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used to create and display web pages. The main difference between the two is their syntax and structure.

    XHTML is stricter for case sensitivity and error handling also it doesnt allows tags without closing tags.
