<!-- How are active links different from normal links?

    Active links are the one with which user has intracted or visited.
    Whenever the user holds the mouse button on the link and not released yet or if right clicked on it, it will change its color into red, this is when the link will be in active state.

    Normal Links are the one with which user has not intracted or unvisited.
